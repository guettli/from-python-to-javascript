# From Python to JavaScript

My findings while learning modern JavaScript.

I learned Python in the year 2001 which is now roughly 20 years ago.

I still think Python is a very good choice, I would choose if over C, C++ or Java because it is so easy and lightweighted.

Up to now there is no established way to run Python in the browser.

During the last days a looked at the [Guide of the main concepts of React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and like it very much. Wow, React is simple and pragmatic, but not dirty like PHP. I  well structured, too. 

The StackoverFlow TagTrend makes it obvious. JQuery is dead and React is the leading JavaScript Library:

For backend stuff I think I will stick to Python, Django and SQL.

## TODO

```
if myvar:
    print('myvar is "true"')
else:
    print('myvar is "false"')
```



## Missing

Things I am missing during learning JavaScript.

In Python it is easy to find the method definition. For example you want to see the implementation of `foo()`, then you
just need to search for `def foo` with your favorite editor or `grep`.

Maybe one small thing which made me love Python is the fact that writing `{` is slightly annoying. On german keyboards you need to hold the `AltGr` key and then press `7`. Most languages (C, C++, Java, JavaScript,...) use this character for blocks And in Python you hardly need this character since blocks get defined by indentation.
